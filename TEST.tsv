Loss of heterochromatin during aging has been observed in a variety of organisms, however, understanding its role in aging-related phenotypes has been limited by the lack of information about the specific cell types and gene loci affected by this type of epigenetic changes. To address this bottleneck, we probed dynamic changes in chromatin landscape at single cell resolution in the forebrain, hippocampus, heart, skeletal muscle and bone marrows from 3-month, 10-month and 18-month-old mice, and characterized age-associated changes in chromatin accessibility at over 300,000 candidate regulatory elements across 34 major cell types. We report that excitatory neurons displayed profound changes in a specific set of heterochromatin domains during aging, evidenced by an increase in chromatin accessibility, a decrease in the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3, and de-repression of non-coding RNA species. These results suggest that heterochromatin maintenance are impaired in aging excitatory neurons, and this may be associated with increased repetitive element activity and neurodegenerative diseases.

Maintaining this relationship requires careful immune balance to contain commensals within the lumen while limiting inflammatory anti-commensal responses1,2. A number of groups describe T cell antigen-specific recognition of intestinal microbes3,4. While the local environment shapes effector cell differentiation3–5 it is unclear how microbiota-specific T cells are educated in the thymus. Here we identify that early life intestinal colonization leads to trafficking of microbial antigens from the intestine to the thymus by intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) which then expand microbiota-specific T cells. Once in the periphery, microbiota-specific T cells have pathogenic potential, or can protect against related pathogens. In this way, the developing microbiota shapes and expands the thymic and peripheral T cell repertoire, allowing for enhanced recognition of intestinal microbes and pathogens.

Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of brain endothelial cells (EC) in young adult and aged mice to characterize their ageing-associated genome-wide expression changes. We identified zonation-dependent transcriptomic changes in aged brain EC subtypes, with capillary ECs exhibiting the most transcriptomic alterations. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed altered immune/cytokine signaling in ECs of all vascular segments, while functional changes impacting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and glucose/energy metabolism were most prominently implicated in ECs of the capillary bed – the primary site where ECs and other neurovascular unit (NVU) cell types closely interact and coordinate to regulate BBB and cerebral blood flow in health and diseased conditions. Furthermore, an overrepresentation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated genes identified from GWAS studies was evident among the human orthologs of differentially expressed genes of aged capillary ECs but not other EC subtypes. Importantly, for numerous EC-enriched differentially expressed genes with important functional roles at the BBB and/or association with AD, we found concordant expression changes in human aged or AD brains. Finally, we demonstrated that treatment with exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, strongly reverses transcriptomic changes in ECs and largely reduces BBB leakage in the aged brain. Thus, our study revealed novel vascular ageing-associations of AD in the brain capillary endothelium, and provides insights into detailed transcriptomic alterations underlying brain EC ageing that are complex with subtype specificity yet amenable to pharmacological interventions.
