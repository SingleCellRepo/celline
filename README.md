## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Project

Single-cell RNA-seq records RNA expression per single cell, which has been the focus of much attention in recent years, and allows analysis of samples consisting of multicellular systems compared to Bulk RNA-seq. However, data acquisition is very costly and not suitable for simple validation.

Public resources such as SRA and GEO are comprehensive databases of genetic data that have been submitted so far. However, it is difficult to collect and reanalyze single-cell RNA-seq data from these data due to the complexity of collection and data structure.

In this study, we constructed a system that enables users to easily obtain Single-cell RNA-seq data in large quantities.

Users can prepare the necessary environment for analysis, download data, and find biological events in one step.
